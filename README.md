# [IfPA Website](https://instituteforpatientaccess.org)

Check the [theme folder](https://github.com/avinoamsn/ifpa/tree/master/wp-content/themes/ifpa_custom) (`wp-content/themes/ifpa_custom`) for the readme.

## Development Processes & Notes (for internal use)

- The IfPA website follows the traditional/legacy WordPress model (WordPress is the full stack. and not just a CMS w/ REST/GRAPHQL)
- Any update should only concern the `wp-content/themes/ifpa_custom` directory.
- Changes to the theme are published by pushing to the WPEngine remotes (production, staging and development).
